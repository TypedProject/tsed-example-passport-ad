## Auth

This implements the Azure Single Page App Auth.   

Azure - set up the App as per:
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-spa-app-registration

Azure - create App Registration
* `Azure > App Registrations > THE_APP > Expose an API` to create scopes (roles).  
* Add it to the app under `Azure > App Registrations > THE_APP > API Permissions`

Azure - set to use version 2 of token:
* `Azure > App > App Active Directory > App Registrations > Manifest` - set accessTokenAcceptedVersion=2

Roles - the scopes for an application need to be assigned to Users or Groups they belong to
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/methods-for-assigning-users-and-groups

For TeD, users must be assigned to the 'ted.translations.search' scope.

There is an Azure developer's blog post on all this at https://joonasw.net/view/defining-permissions-and-roles-in-aad.

Copy the clientId that was created during the app registration process, and also the tennantId that is your organizations tennant.  Paste these in to a ~/.env file and as Azure Application Settings in your Application Service. 

Copy the scope(s) created and add them to the configuration in `Server.ts`.

Define some environment settings for the Angular client in the src/environments files - passing `-configuration=<env>` to startup:

    ng serve --port 4201 --configuration=dev
